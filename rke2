4. **Add Insecure Registry Configuration:**
   - Add or update the configuration to include the private registry as insecure. Use the following format:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: rke2.io/v1
     kind: Cluster
     spec:
       # Existing configuration
       rke2Config:
         # Other RKE2 config settings
         # Add the following under rke2Config
         - --registry-mirrors=https://my-private-registry:5000
         - --insecure-registry=my-private-registry:5000
     ```

   - Replace `my-private-registry:5000` with the actual address and port of your private registry.

### 3. Apply the Configuration

- Save the changes to update the cluster configuration.

### 4. Restart RKE2 Nodes

- For the changes to take effect, you may need to restart your RKE2 nodes. This can be done by either rebooting the nodes or using RKE2 commands to restart the service.

  ```bash
  systemctl restart rke2-server
