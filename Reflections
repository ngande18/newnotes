Key Achievements and Highlights

Completed Dynatrace Upgrade for All OpenShift Clusters

Successfully upgraded Dynatrace monitoring across all OpenShift clusters, ensuring improved performance and enhanced monitoring capabilities. This upgrade has led to better insights and faster issue resolution. The Dynatrace upgrades were performed three times during the year to maintain compatibility for application deep monitoring.

Successfully Completed Two Disaster Recovery Exercises

Led and executed two comprehensive OpenShift Disaster Recovery (DR) exercises, showcasing our readiness for potential system failures while ensuring data integrity and business continuity. These exercises underscored our team's capability to respond effectively in crisis scenarios.

Progress on OpenShift v2 Architecture with ACM

Achieved significant milestones toward the OpenShift v2 architecture by advancing work on Advanced Cluster Management (ACM). This initiative is vital for enhancing our infrastructure's scalability and efficiency, with my contributions playing a key role in driving the project forward. Additionally, completed the F5 multi-cluster ingress POC in the F5 lab and am now working towards implementing it in the OpenShift ecosystem, which will be a significant win for OpenShift v2 multi-cluster ingress.

Built Workload Migration Plan

Developed a workload migration plan to transition workloads seamlessly from the old legacy OpenShift cluster to the new cluster without causing application downtime. This process ensures a smooth migration for all workloads, saving significant manual hours and costs.

Supporting OpenShift Virtualization POC

Provided support for the OpenShift Virtualization POC by leveraging expertise in the OpenShift virtualization framework. Collaborated with the virtualization team to build the POC environment, facilitating the migration from VMware to OpenShift virtualization.

Summary

Overall, it was a very productive and enlightening year. Not only did I enhance my knowledge in new technologies, but I also played a significant role in major upgrades, such as OpenShift and Argo, ensuring the ecosystem remained up-to-date. Additionally, I was deeply involved in the PCF migration, whether supporting application teams, increasing capacity, or building clusters. These efforts have contributed significantly to the success of our projects and the team's growth.

Ongoing Efforts for Next Year

Looking ahead, I aim to further expand my knowledge of OpenShift 2.0, particularly focusing on Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) for multi-cluster management and Advanced Cluster Security (ACS) to enhance vulnerability posture. I also plan to deepen my understanding of AI technologies, including LLMs and Generative AI. As a first step, I am committed to completing the Red Hat OpenShift AI certification, which is at the top of my learning objectives for the year.
